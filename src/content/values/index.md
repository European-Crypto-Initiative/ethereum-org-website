# EUCI Values {#euci-values}

The members of EUCI have commonly set forth the following principles. The actions of the association are guided by those principles and are directed at the realization of the vision set forth. The respect of those principles is mandatory for all the members.

## Current Website

We fight for inclusion, open competition, open networks & APIs, low barriers of entry & more.

## Crypto-assets

Tokens of all kinds are poised to improve the existing economic infrastructure worldwide, empower businesses and individuals to innovate and participate, and provide novel exchange opportunities across the globe and within local communities.

## Openness

The open nature of crypto value networks is the decisive factor that produces innovation today and will continue to create tremendous value if preserved and promoted. Open-source and transparent networks, secured by open consensus protocols to which any interested party can contribute, are the most suitable architecture.

## Innovation

Open networks allow for innovation in radically pioneering fields, such as programmable coordination mechanisms, decentralized applications or storage, and privacy-preserving digital identities. Innovation in those fields must be encouraged by the authorities and not hindered by rushed regulation.

## Ethics

Enterprises and individuals building and operating those networks, assets and use cases must act responsibly and ethically to ensure a positive and sustainable long-term impact for the society.

## Balance

Regulation of the digital assets space should be tailored to ensure a clear balance between, on the one hand, consumer and investor protection and, on the other hand, the highest possible degree of innovation.
