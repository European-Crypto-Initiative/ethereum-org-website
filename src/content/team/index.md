# Team {#euci-team}

We have 15+ years of combined experience in pro-bono crypto advocacy with policy-makers and have done extensive policy drafting in our respective countries (France, Germany, Slovenia) and at the EU level. We have created an informal initiative for the last 12 months and started the work under the EUCI name. We have had 100+ meetings and touch points with EU policy makers, built a deep network and considerable reputation in the EU institutions, and were successful in getting some DeFi-exceptions into the EUâ€™s latest proposal on regulatoring all crypto assets in Europe.
